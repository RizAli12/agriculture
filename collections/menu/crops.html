The cash crops are cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, mustard and sesame. The total area, yield and production of each crop is now discussed under separate heads.

(A) FOODS CROPS

(1) Wheat: Wheat is the principal food crop of the people. It occupies an important position i farming policies. The share of wheat is 3% to GDP. The area under wheat crop was 8494 thousand hectares and wheat output stood at 23.52 million tons and it contributed 14.4% to value added in agriculture in 2006-07.</p>

<p>
(2) Rice: Rice is the 2nd largest food crop in Pakistan. It is now a major export item accounting for 6.1% of total export earnings over the last five years and contributes 1.2% to GDP. The production of rice during 1999-2000 was 5156 thousand tones. It came down to 3882 thousand tones in 2001-02 and increased to 5438 thousand tones in 2006-07. The Government of Pakistan is taking effective measures to increase the yield, production quality and export of rice. Research efforts are continuing on developing high yielding basmati and Iris varieties. Emphasis is also being laid on agronomic research as well as on improved extension services fertilizer use, direct seeding etc. The flow of inputs and credits is also being substantially increased. Spray is also provided to the rice growers at subsidized rates.</p>



<p>(3) Maize: Maize is an important food grain as well raw material for edible oil production.
