 <h1>Water Issue in Pakistan</h1> 

<img class="myborder" src="images/wateris.jpg" width="650" height="350"/>

<p> Research tells that nowhere on Earth is the critical inter-relationship between water and agriculture more evident than in the Asia-Pacific region, home to 61 per cent of the world's people and with its population expected to reach five billion by 2050.</p>

<p> Water shortage can directly hit the economic growth of Pakistan as it is not only the cheapest source of power generation but is also the lifeline of agriculture sector. It is a matter of concern that water scarcity is increasing with every passing day but we are throwing away more than 35 million acre feet water to the sea. Pakistan can hardly escape from becoming a big desert, unless drastic measures are taken instantly. </p>
    

<p>A couple of years ago, some relevant Pakistani government departments had hinted that the water availability in the country had plummeted from 5,300 cubic metres per person in 1950 to almost 1,000 cubic metres to touch the globally set water scarcity level, but no government functionary had moved.</p>

<p>It was also predicted that average agriculture produce in the country would drop 25 per cent by 2050 due to water shortage, resulting in increased poverty and hunger, but no eyebrows were raised in the cozy power corridors! </p>

<p>Meanwhile, numerous reports from reputed institutions had pointed out that not only was the unabated over-pumping in the country depleting the ground water resource, but 5,000 million gallons of used and untreated wastewater was also being discharged into rivers and lakes, hence polluting the source.</p>

<p>But all these alarming facts had fallen on deaf ears. </p>
