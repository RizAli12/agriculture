<p>During last decades the consumer trust in food quality has drastically decreased, mainly because of the growing ecological awareness and several food scandals, dioxins and bacterial contamination. It has been found that intensive conventional agriculture could introduce contaminants into food chain, first of all nitrates and nitrosamines, residues of pesticides, antibiotics and growth hormones. Consumers started to look for safer and better controlled foods, produced in more environmentally friendly, authentic and local system. </p>

<p> Ensuring an acceptable level of food quality and safety is necessary to provide adequate protection for consumers and to facilitate trade. These objectives can be achieved by implementing and monitoring quality assurance measures along the entire food chain, when it is appropriate and when it is possible. Everyone involved with food, from the farmer to the consumer, shares in the responsibilities to keep the food supply safe by taking the necessary precautions to keep food protected from hazards that can increase human health risks. These actions will also prevent or reduce food losses, which is especially important in those situations where food security is threatened. </p>

<p>Implementing quality assurance measures starts at the farm with the application of good agricultural practices (GAPs) and good veterinary practices (GVPs). GAPs are those practices that enhance the production of food that is safe and of good quality, that are environmentally sound and that ensure appropriate handling, storage, shipping and management of the product. When GAPs are appropriately applied to the production of primary food crops, consumers can be assured that the food will meet quality and safety standards at the time of harvest. </p>
